{"id": 2, "question": "A set of jobs `Jobs` need to be processed on a set of machines `Machines` in series. All jobs have the same processing order through all the machines from machine 1 to machine M. Each machine can work in parallel. The workflow is the following: the first job of the sequence goes to the first machine to be processed; meanwhile, other jobs wait; when the first machine has processed the first job, the first job goes to the second machine and the second job of the sequence starts to be processed by the first machine; and so on. The time required to process job `j` on machine `m` is `ProcesTime_{j, m}`. The problem aims to minimize the total makespan. The goal is to find a sequence of jobs that minimize the makespan: the time when all jobs have been processed.\nParameters: {\"jobs\": [1, 2, 3], \"schedules\": [1, 2, 3], \"machines\": [1, 2], \"proces_time\": [[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1]]}", "ground_truth": 7.0}

{"id": 4, "ground_truth": 30400.0, "question": "A farmer needs to decide how many cows, sheep, and chickens to raise in order to achieve maximum profit. The farmer can sell cows, sheep, and chickens for $500, $200, and $8 each, respectively. The feed costs for each cow, sheep, and chicken are $100, $80, and $5, respectively. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the feed cost. Each cow, sheep, and chicken produces 10, 5, and 3 units of manure per day, respectively. Due to the limited time the farm staff has for cleaning the farm each day, they can handle up to 800 units of manure. Additionally, because of the limited farm size, the farmer can raise at most 50 chickens. Furthermore, the farmer must have at least 10 cows to meet customer demand. The farmer must also raise at least 20 sheep. Finally, the total number of animals cannot exceed 100."}
{"id": 18, "question": "The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is the problem of deciding a landing time on an appropriate runway for each aircraft in a given set of aircraft such that each aircraft lands within a predetermined time window; and separation criteria between the landing of an aircraft, and the landing of all successive aircraft, are respected. We are given the earliest landing time, latest landing time, target landing time, and penalties for landing before or after the target landing time for each aircraft. There is also a separation time that represents the minimum time required between the landing of two aircraft. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total penalties of landing before or after the target time for each aircraft. The problem includes several constraints. The order constraint ensures that the aircrafts land in a specific order. The separation constraint ensures that there is enough separation time between the landing of aircraft. The lower and upper time window constraints ensure that each aircraft lands within its respective earliest and latest time windows.\nParameters: {\"EarliestLanding\": [1, 3, 5], \"LatestLanding\": [10, 12, 15], \"TargetLanding\": [4, 8, 14], \"PenaltyAfterTarget\": [10, 20, 30], \"PenaltyBeforeTarget\": [5, 10, 15], \"SeparationTime\": [[0, 2, 3], [2, 0, 4], [3, 4, 0]]}", "ground_truth": 0.0}
