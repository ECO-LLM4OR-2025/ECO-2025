**DIMENSION 1 - Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis: The code correctly defines the three aircraft indices, landing-time variables x[i] bounded by the given earliest and latest windows, and the earliness/tardiness variables with non-negativity. Parameter arrays E, L, T, alpha, beta, and sep_matrix exactly match the problem statement. All problem entities (each aircraft, its time window, separation requirements) are represented.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 - Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis: The objective (minimize total earliness/tardiness penalties) is properly linear and matches the problem. All essential constraints are present: time-window bounds via variable bounds, the balance equation x_i–T_i=eplus_i–eminus_i, non-negativity for eplus/eminus, and the separation constraints for the fixed order. The model is a pure LP with continuous variables, appropriate for this formulation.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 - Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis: No numerical infeasibility or unboundedness issues are apparent in the model formulation. However, execution fails immediately with “ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘gurobipy’,” so the solver never runs. This is an environment/dependency issue, not a modeling flaw.  
Issues Found: Missing Gurobi Python package in the execution environment  
Confidence: High  

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**  
Primary Issues:  
1. The code depends on Gurobi’s Python API (gurobipy), which is not installed or available.  

Recommended Actions:  
- Install/configure gurobipy in the environment (ensure Gurobi license and PATH are set).  
- Or switch to an open-source solver (e.g., use PuLP or OR-Tools) by rewriting the import and model-creation calls.  
- After resolving the solver import, rerun to confirm numerical feasibility and obtain the optimal landing schedule.
