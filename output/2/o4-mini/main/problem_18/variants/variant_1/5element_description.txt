Sets:
I: Set of aircraft, indexed by i ∈ {1,2,3}

Variables:
t[i] ∈ ℝ: landing time of aircraft i  
e[i] ∈ ℝ₊: early deviation for aircraft i (if it lands before its target)  
l[i] ∈ ℝ₊: late deviation for aircraft i (if it lands after its target)

Parameters:
E[i]: earliest landing time for aircraft i  
L[i]: latest landing time for aircraft i  
T[i]: target landing time for aircraft i  
Pb[i]: penalty per unit time if aircraft i lands before T[i]  
Pa[i]: penalty per unit time if aircraft i lands after T[i]  
S[i,j]: required separation time between aircraft i and j (if i lands before j)

Constraints:
1. Time window constraints:  
   ∀ i ∈ I:  
     t[i] ≥ E[i]  
     t[i] ≤ L[i]

2. Separation constraints (order enforced by index):  
   ∀ i,j ∈ I with i < j:  
     t[j] − t[i] ≥ S[i,j]

3. Deviation definitions:  
   ∀ i ∈ I:  
     e[i] ≥ T[i] − t[i]  
     l[i] ≥ t[i] − T[i]  
     e[i] ≥ 0, l[i] ≥ 0

Objective:
Minimize ∑_{i∈I} (Pb[i] * e[i] + Pa[i] * l[i])
