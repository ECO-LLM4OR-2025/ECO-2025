Sets:
 I: set of aircraft indices {1, 2, 3}

Variables:
 x_i ∈ ℝ: landing time of aircraft i
 eplus_i ∈ ℝ₊: tardiness of aircraft i (amount by which landing is after target)
 eminus_i ∈ ℝ₊: earliness of aircraft i (amount by which landing is before target)

Parameters:
 E_i: earliest allowable landing time of aircraft i
 L_i: latest allowable landing time of aircraft i
 T_i: target landing time of aircraft i
 α_i: penalty per unit tardiness for aircraft i
 β_i: penalty per unit earliness for aircraft i
 sep_{i,j}: required separation time if aircraft i lands before aircraft j

Constraints:
 1. Time windows: for all i ∈ I,
      E_i ≤ x_i ≤ L_i
 2. Earliness/tardiness balance: for all i ∈ I,
      x_i − T_i = eplus_i − eminus_i
 3. Non-negativity: for all i ∈ I,
      eplus_i ≥ 0,  eminus_i ≥ 0
 4. Separation & fixed order (1 before 2 before 3): for all i,j ∈ I with i<j,
      x_j ≥ x_i + sep_{i,j}

Objective:
 Minimize ∑_{i ∈ I} ( α_i · eplus_i + β_i · eminus_i )
