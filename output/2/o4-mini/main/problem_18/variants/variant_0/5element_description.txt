Sets:
I = {1, 2, 3}  // set of aircraft

Variables:
t[i] ∈ R  // landing time of aircraft i
earl[i] ≥ 0 ∈ R  // earliness of aircraft i (landing before target)
tard[i] ≥ 0 ∈ R  // tardiness of aircraft i (landing after target)

Parameters:
E[i]  // earliest landing time for aircraft i
L[i]  // latest landing time for aircraft i
T[i]  // target landing time for aircraft i
pb[i]  // penalty per unit time for landing before target for aircraft i
pa[i]  // penalty per unit time for landing after target for aircraft i
S[i,j]  // minimum separation time between landing of i and landing of j

Constraints:
1. Time window constraints:
   ∀ i ∈ I: E[i] ≤ t[i] ≤ L[i]
2. E-T earliness and tardiness definition:
   ∀ i ∈ I:
     earl[i] ≥ T[i] - t[i]
     tard[i] ≥ t[i] - T[i]
3. Separation constraints in prescribed order (i<j):
   ∀ i, j ∈ I with i < j:
     t[j] ≥ t[i] + S[i,j]

Objective:
Minimize ∑_{i ∈ I} [ pb[i] * earl[i] + pa[i] * tard[i] ]
