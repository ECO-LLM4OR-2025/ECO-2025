Sets:
  There is a single index set A = {c, s, h} representing the three animal types:
    c = cows
    s = sheep
    h = chickens

Variables:
  x_c ∈ Z₊ : number of cows
  x_s ∈ Z₊ : number of sheep
  x_h ∈ Z₊ : number of chickens

Parameters:
  p_c = 500   (selling price per cow)
  p_s = 200   (selling price per sheep)
  p_h =   8   (selling price per chicken)
  f_c = 100   (feed cost per cow)
  f_s =  80   (feed cost per sheep)
  f_h =   5   (feed cost per chicken)
  m_c =  10   (manure units per cow per day)
  m_s =   5   (manure units per sheep per day)
  m_h =   3   (manure units per chicken per day)
  M_max = 800 (maximum manure units handled per day)
  H_max = 50  (maximum chickens due to space)
  C_min = 10  (minimum cows required)
  S_min = 20  (minimum sheep required)
  A_max =100  (maximum total animals)

Derived profit parameters:
  π_c = p_c - f_c = 400
  π_s = p_s - f_s = 120
  π_h = p_h - f_h =   3

Constraints:
  1) Manure capacity:   m_c x_c + m_s x_s + m_h x_h ≤ M_max
  2) Chicken capacity:  x_h ≤ H_max
  3) Minimum cows:       x_c ≥ C_min
  4) Minimum sheep:      x_s ≥ S_min
  5) Total animals:      x_c + x_s + x_h ≤ A_max
  6) Integrality:        x_c, x_s, x_h ∈ Z₊

Objective:
  Maximize total profit: π_c x_c + π_s x_s + π_h x_h
