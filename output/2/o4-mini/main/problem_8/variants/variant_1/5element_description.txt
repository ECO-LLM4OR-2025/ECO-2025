Sets:
Products = {Scooter, Bike}

Variables:
x_Scooter ∈ Integer, ≥ 0  (number of scooters to produce)
x_Bike    ∈ Integer, ≥ 0  (number of bikes to produce)

Parameters:
p_Scooter = 200      (profit per scooter)
p_Bike    = 300      (profit per bike)
d_Scooter = 2        (design hours per scooter)
d_Bike    = 4        (design hours per bike)
e_Scooter = 3        (engineering hours per scooter)
e_Bike    = 5        (engineering hours per bike)
D_capacity = 5000    (total design hours available)
E_capacity = 6000    (total engineering hours available)

Constraints:
1) Design capacity:  d_Scooter * x_Scooter + d_Bike * x_Bike ≤ D_capacity
   ⇒ 2·x_Scooter + 4·x_Bike ≤ 5000
2) Engineering capacity:  e_Scooter * x_Scooter + e_Bike * x_Bike ≤ E_capacity
   ⇒ 3·x_Scooter + 5·x_Bike ≤ 6000
3) Nonnegativity and integrality: x_Scooter, x_Bike ≥ 0 and integer

Objective:
Maximize total profit = p_Scooter * x_Scooter + p_Bike * x_Bike
                         = 200·x_Scooter + 300·x_Bike
