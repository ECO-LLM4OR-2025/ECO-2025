Sets:
Products: set of products = {scooter, bike}

Variables:
x_scooter ∈ R⁺: number of scooters to produce per month
x_bike ∈ R⁺: number of bikes to produce per month

Parameters:
profit_scooter = 200  # profit per scooter
profit_bike = 300     # profit per bike
design_time_scooter = 2   # design hours required per scooter
design_time_bike = 4      # design hours required per bike
eng_time_scooter = 3      # engineering hours required per scooter
eng_time_bike = 5         # engineering hours required per bike
avail_design_time = 5000  # total available design hours per month
avail_eng_time = 6000     # total available engineering hours per month

Constraints:
1) 2 * x_scooter + 4 * x_bike ≤ 5000       (design team capacity)
2) 3 * x_scooter + 5 * x_bike ≤ 6000       (engineering team capacity)
3) x_scooter ≥ 0, x_bike ≥ 0                (non-negativity)

Objective:
Maximize Z = 200 * x_scooter + 300 * x_bike
