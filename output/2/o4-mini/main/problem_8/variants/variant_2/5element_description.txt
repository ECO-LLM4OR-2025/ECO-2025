Sets:
Products: P = {scooter, bike}

Variables:
x[p] for p in P: integer, >= 0, number of units of product p to produce

Parameters:
profit[p]:
  profit[scooter] = 200
  profit[bike] = 300
design_time[p]:
  design_time[scooter] = 2
  design_time[bike] = 4
eng_time[p]:
  eng_time[scooter] = 3
  eng_time[bike] = 5
avail_design = 5000
avail_engineering = 6000

Constraints:
1. sum_{p in P} design_time[p] * x[p] <= avail_design
2. sum_{p in P} eng_time[p] * x[p] <= avail_engineering
3. x[p] >= 0 and integer for all p in P

Objective:
Maximize sum_{p in P} profit[p] * x[p]
