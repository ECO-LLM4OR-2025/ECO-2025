Sets:
Jobs: set of jobs, indexed by j ∈ {1,…,J}
Positions: sequence positions, indexed by k ∈ {1,…,J}
Machines: set of machines in series, indexed by m ∈ {1,…,M}

Variables:
Y[j,k] ∈ {0,1} binary variable, 1 if job j is assigned to position k in the sequence
C[k,m] ≥ 0 continuous, completion time of the job in position k on machine m
C_max ≥ 0 continuous, makespan (time when all jobs have completed processing)

Parameters:
p[j,m] processing time of job j on machine m, known data

Constraints:
1. Assignment constraints (each job in exactly one position; each position filled by exactly one job):
   ∑_{k=1}^J Y[j,k] = 1 ∀ j ∈ Jobs
   ∑_{j=1}^J Y[j,k] = 1 ∀ k ∈ Positions

2. Flow-shop timing on machine 1:
   For k = 1:
     C[1,1] ≥ ∑_{j=1}^J p[j,1] * Y[j,1]
   For k = 2,…,J:
     C[k,1] ≥ C[k−1,1] + ∑_{j=1}^J p[j,1] * Y[j,k]

3. Flow-shop timing for machines m = 2,…,M:
   For each m > 1 and position k = 1:
     C[1,m] ≥ C[1,m−1] + ∑_{j=1}^J p[j,m] * Y[j,1]
   For each m > 1 and k = 2,…,J:
     C[k,m] ≥ C[k,m−1] + ∑_{j=1}^J p[j,m] * Y[j,k]
     C[k,m] ≥ C[k−1,m] + ∑_{j=1}^J p[j,m] * Y[j,k]

4. Makespan definition:
   C_max ≥ C[J,M]

Objective:
Minimize C_max
