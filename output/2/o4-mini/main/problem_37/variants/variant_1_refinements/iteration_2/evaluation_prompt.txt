You are an expert operations research analyst. I need your help evaluating and diagnosing issues in an optimization problem solution. Please perform a systematic Chain-of-Thought evaluation across three key dimensions.

    ## Problem Description:
    An artisan makes two types of terracotta jars: a thin jar and a stubby jar. Each thin jar requires 50 minutes of shaping time and 90 minutes of baking time. Each stubby jar requires 30 minutes of shaping time and 150 minutes of baking time. Per week, there are 3000 minutes available for shaping and 4000 minutes available for baking. The profit per thin jar is $5 and the profit per stubby jar is $9. How many jars of each type should the artisan make to maximize profit?

    ## Please perform systematic evaluation across THREE dimensions:

    ### 🔍 Dimension 1: Definition Consistency
    Analyze whether the five element aligns with the problem description:
    - Are all variables properly defined and named according to the problem context?
    - Do the parameter values match what's described in the problem?
    - Are all problem entities (e.g., facilities, customers, resources) correctly represented?
    - Is the problem scope and scale correctly captured?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 2: Structural Soundness  
    Evaluate the mathematical model structure:
    - Is the objective function correctly formulated (minimization vs maximization)?
    - Are all necessary constraints included?
    - Are there any missing or redundant constraints?
    - Is the model type appropriate (linear, integer, mixed-integer)?
    - Are variable types (continuous, binary, integer) correctly specified?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 3: Numerical Validity
    Assess the numerical aspects and execution:
    - If successful: Does the optimal value seem reasonable given the problem context?
    - If failed: What is the root cause of the execution error?
    - Are there any obvious numerical issues (infeasibility, unboundedness)?
    - Are the constraint right-hand-sides and coefficients reasonable?
