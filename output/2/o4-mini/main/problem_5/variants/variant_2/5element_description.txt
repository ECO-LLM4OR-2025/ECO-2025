Sets:
- P: set of flooring products, P = {hardwood, vinyl}

Variables:
- x_h: continuous, quantity (square feet) of hardwood produced weekly
- x_v: continuous, quantity (square feet) of vinyl produced weekly

Parameters:
- min_h = 20000: minimum demand for hardwood (sq ft)
- min_v = 10000: minimum demand for vinyl (sq ft)
- min_total = 60000: minimum total shipment requirement (sq ft)
- max_h = 50000: maximum production capacity for hardwood (sq ft)
- max_v = 30000: maximum production capacity for vinyl (sq ft)
- profit_h = 2.5: profit per sq ft of hardwood ($)
- profit_v = 3.0: profit per sq ft of vinyl ($)

Constraints:
1. Demand constraints:
   - x_h ≥ min_h
   - x_v ≥ min_v
2. Shipping contract:
   - x_h + x_v ≥ min_total
3. Production capacity:
   - x_h ≤ max_h
   - x_v ≤ max_v
4. Nonnegativity:
   - x_h ≥ 0, x_v ≥ 0

Objective:
- Maximize total profit = profit_h * x_h + profit_v * x_v
