Sets:
Products P = {hardwood, vinyl}

Variables:
For each p in P:
  x_p  continuous ≥ 0  # square feet produced of product p

Parameters:
profit_h = 2.5     # profit per square foot of hardwood
profit_v = 3.0     # profit per square foot of vinyl
demand_h_min = 20000   # minimum demand of hardwood (sq ft)
demand_v_min = 10000   # minimum demand of vinyl (sq ft)
ship_total_min = 60000 # minimum total shipped sq ft
prod_h_max = 50000     # maximum production capacity of hardwood (sq ft)
prod_v_max = 30000     # maximum production capacity of vinyl (sq ft)

Constraints:
1. Demand satisfaction
   x_h ≥ demand_h_min
   x_v ≥ demand_v_min
2. Shipping contract
   x_h + x_v ≥ ship_total_min
3. Production capacity
   x_h ≤ prod_h_max
   x_v ≤ prod_v_max

Objective:
Maximize total profit = profit_h * x_h + profit_v * x_v
