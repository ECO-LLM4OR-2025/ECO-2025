Sets:
- V = {bike, scooter} : the set of electric vehicle types.

Variables:
- x[v] for v in V: integer, number of vehicles of type v to use.

Parameters:
- cap[bike] = 8 : meals capacity of a bike.
- cap[scooter] = 5 : meals capacity of a scooter.
- chg[bike] = 3 : charge units required per bike.
- chg[scooter] = 2 : charge units required per scooter.
- C_total = 200 : total available charge units.
- α = 0.30 : maximum fraction of vehicles that can be bikes.
- y_min = 20 : minimum number of scooters required.

Constraints:
1. Charge budget: chg[bike] * x[bike] + chg[scooter] * x[scooter] ≤ C_total.
2. Bike share limit: x[bike] ≤ α * ( x[bike] + x[scooter] ), which linearizes to 7*x[bike] ≤ 3*x[scooter].
3. Minimum scooters: x[scooter] ≥ y_min.
4. Integrality and nonnegativity: x[bike], x[scooter] ∈ Z₊.

Objective:
Maximize total meals delivered:  cap[bike] * x[bike] + cap[scooter] * x[scooter].
