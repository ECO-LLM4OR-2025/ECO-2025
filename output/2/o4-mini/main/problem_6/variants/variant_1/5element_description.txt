Sets:
V = {bike, scooter}

Variables:
x_bike: integer, number of bikes used
x_scooter: integer, number of scooters used

Parameters:
charge_bike = 3         (charge units per bike)
charge_scooter = 2      (charge units per scooter)
cap_bike = 8            (meals per bike)
cap_scooter = 5         (meals per scooter)
total_charge = 200      (available charge units)
max_bike_share = 0.30   (maximum fraction of vehicles that can be bikes)
min_scooters = 20       (minimum number of scooters)

Constraints:
1. Charge capacity: charge_bike * x_bike + charge_scooter * x_scooter <= total_charge
2. Bike share limit: x_bike <= max_bike_share * (x_bike + x_scooter)
   (Linearized as 7 * x_bike <= 3 * x_scooter)
3. Minimum scooters: x_scooter >= min_scooters
4. Nonnegativity and integrality: x_bike, x_scooter >= 0 and integer

Objective:
Maximize total meals delivered = cap_bike * x_bike + cap_scooter * x_scooter
