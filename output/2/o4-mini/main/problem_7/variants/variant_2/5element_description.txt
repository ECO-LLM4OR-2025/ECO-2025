Sets:
Products: P = {chair, dresser}

Variables:
x_chair ∈ ℤ≥0 (number of chairs to produce)
x_dresser ∈ ℤ≥0 (number of dressers to produce)

Parameters:
profit_chair = 43       (profit per chair)
profit_dresser = 52     (profit per dresser)
stain_chair = 1.4       (gallons of stain per chair)
stain_dresser = 1.1     (gallons of stain per dresser)
wood_chair = 2          (lengths of oak wood per chair)
wood_dresser = 3        (lengths of oak wood per dresser)
avail_stain = 17        (total gallons of stain available per week)
avail_wood = 11         (total lengths of oak wood available per week)

Constraints:
1) Stain constraint: stain_chair * x_chair + stain_dresser * x_dresser ≤ avail_stain
2) Wood constraint: wood_chair * x_chair + wood_dresser * x_dresser ≤ avail_wood
3) Non-negativity and integrality: x_chair ≥ 0, x_dresser ≥ 0 and integer

Objective:
Maximize total profit = profit_chair * x_chair + profit_dresser * x_dresser
