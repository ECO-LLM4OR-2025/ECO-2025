You are an expert operations research analyst. I need your help evaluating and diagnosing issues in an optimization problem solution. Please perform a systematic Chain-of-Thought evaluation across three key dimensions.

    ## Problem Description:
    A flooring company produces engineered hardwood and vinyl planks. Their sales forecasts show an expected demand of at least 20,000 square foot of hardwood and 10,000 square feet of vinyl planks each week. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least 60,000 square feet of flooring much be shipped each week. Due to a labor shortage issue, no more than 50,000 square feet of hardwood and 30,000  square feet of vinyl  can be produced weekly. If a square foot of hardwood flooring yields a profit of $2.5 and a square foot of vinyl planks produces a $3 profit, how many of each type of flooring should be made weekly to maximize the company's profit?

    ## Current Iteration: 3

    ## Variant Information:
    
### Current Solution Code:
```python
import sys

def main():
    """
    Builds and solves the flooring production LP using Gurobi.
    Produces the maximum profit under demand, shipping, and capacity constraints.
    Writes only the numeric optimal value to 'ref_optimal_value.txt'.

                 "Please install Gurobi and configure the environment.")

    profit_h = 2.5     # profit per sqft of hardwood

### Execution Result: FAILED

    ## Please perform systematic evaluation across THREE dimensions:

    ### 🔍 Dimension 1: Definition Consistency
    Analyze whether the five element aligns with the problem description:
    - Are all variables properly defined and named according to the problem context?
    - Do the parameter values match what's described in the problem?
    - Are all problem entities (e.g., facilities, customers, resources) correctly represented?
    - Is the problem scope and scale correctly captured?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 2: Structural Soundness  
    Evaluate the mathematical model structure:
    - Is the objective function correctly formulated (minimization vs maximization)?
    - Are all necessary constraints included?
    - Are there any missing or redundant constraints?
    - Is the model type appropriate (linear, integer, mixed-integer)?
    - Are variable types (continuous, binary, integer) correctly specified?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 3: Numerical Validity
    Assess the numerical aspects and execution:
    - If successful: Does the optimal value seem reasonable given the problem context?
    - If failed: What is the root cause of the execution error?
    - Are there any obvious numerical issues (infeasibility, unboundedness)?
    - Are the constraint right-hand-sides and coefficients reasonable?
