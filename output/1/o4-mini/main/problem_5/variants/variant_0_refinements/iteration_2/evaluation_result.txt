**DIMENSION 1 - Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis: The code’s decision‐variable names, parameter names and values all correspond exactly to the problem statement. ‘profit_h’, ‘profit_v’, ‘demand_h’, ‘demand_v’, ‘ship_min’, ‘cap_h’ and ‘cap_v’ match the hardwood and vinyl profit, demand, shipping and capacity numbers given in the text. Both Gurobi and PuLP formulations introduce non‐negative continuous x_h and x_v to represent produced square feet. There are no extra products or missing entities.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 - Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
- Objective: Correctly maximizes 2.5·hardwood + 3·vinyl.  
- Constraints: Includes lower‐bounds for each product (demand), a combined lower‐bound for shipping, and upper‐bounds for capacity. Nonnegativity is enforced via lb=0.  
- No constraints are redundant (the shipping ≥60 000 can bind above the individual demands) nor missing.  
- The problem is a straightforward continuous linear program, and variable types are correctly continuous.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 - Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis: The mathematical model is neither infeasible nor unbounded given the parameter values (feasible region exists between demand and capacity, and profit coefficients are finite). The failure occurs at runtime because neither Gurobi nor PuLP is installed in the environment, so the code aborts before solving.  
Issues Found:  
  1. Missing solver dependencies (Gurobi and PuLP are not available).  
Confidence: High  

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:  
Primary Issues:  
  1. The execution environment lacks the required solver libraries.  

Recommended Actions:  
  - Install a supported solver library (e.g. pip-install PuLP which bundles CBC, or install Gurobi and its Python API).  
  - Alternatively, modify the code to detect and install a pure-Python LP solver or invoke an external solver.  
  - Once a solver is present, rerun the model; the expected optimal solution is hardwood = 30 000 sqft, vinyl = 30 000 sqft (profit = \$165 000).
