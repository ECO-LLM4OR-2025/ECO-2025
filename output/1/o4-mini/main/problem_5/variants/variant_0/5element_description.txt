Sets:
  P = {hardwood, vinyl}

Variables:
  x_h: continuous, square feet of hardwood produced
  x_v: continuous, square feet of vinyl produced

Parameters:
  p_h = 2.5       (profit per sqft of hardwood)
  p_v = 3.0       (profit per sqft of vinyl)
  d_h = 20000     (minimum demand for hardwood)
  d_v = 10000     (minimum demand for vinyl)
  L   = 60000     (minimum total shipping requirement)
  u_h = 50000     (maximum production capacity for hardwood)
  u_v = 30000     (maximum production capacity for vinyl)

Constraints:
  1) x_h ≥ d_h              (satisfy hardwood demand)
  2) x_v ≥ d_v              (satisfy vinyl demand)
  3) x_h + x_v ≥ L          (total shipping requirement)
  4) x_h ≤ u_h              (hardwood capacity limit)
  5) x_v ≤ u_v              (vinyl capacity limit)

Objective:
  Maximize Z = p_h * x_h + p_v * x_v
