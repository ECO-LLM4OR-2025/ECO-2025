Sets:
- M = {A, B, C}, the set of manufacturers.

Variables:
- x_A, x_B, x_C ∈ ℤ₊: number of orders from manufacturers A, B, C.
- y_A, y_B, y_C ∈ {0,1}: 1 if we place at least one order from A, B, C, respectively; 0 otherwise.

Parameters:
- chairs_per_order: a_A = 15, a_B = 10, a_C = 10
- cost_per_order: c_A = 15*50 = 750, c_B = 10*45 = 450, c_C = 10*40 = 400
- L = 100 (minimum total chairs)
- U = 500 (maximum total chairs)

Constraints:
1. Total chairs between 100 and 500:
   15 x_A + 10 x_B + 10 x_C ≥ 100  
   15 x_A + 10 x_B + 10 x_C ≤ 500
2. Link order counts to binaries (big-M linking):
   x_A ≤ ⌊U/15⌋ y_A,   x_A ≥ y_A  
   x_B ≤ ⌊U/10⌋ y_B,    x_B ≥ y_B  
   x_C ≤ ⌊U/10⌋ y_C,    x_C ≥ y_C  
3. Logical implications:
   If we order from A then from B: y_A ≤ y_B  
   If we order from B then from C: y_B ≤ y_C  

Objective:
- Minimize total cost = 750 x_A + 450 x_B + 400 x_C
