Sets:
  I = {A, B, C}  // manufacturers

Variables:
  x_i ∈ Integer ≥ 0    // number of orders from manufacturer i ∈ I
  y_i ∈ {0,1}          // binary usage indicator for manufacturer i ∈ I

Parameters:
  chairs_per_order[A] = 15
  chairs_per_order[B] = 10
  chairs_per_order[C] = 10
  cost_per_chair[A]    = 50
  cost_per_chair[B]    = 45
  cost_per_chair[C]    = 40
  min_chairs           = 100
  max_chairs           = 500
  M[A] = floor(max_chairs / chairs_per_order[A]) = 33
  M[B] = floor(max_chairs / chairs_per_order[B]) = 50
  M[C] = floor(max_chairs / chairs_per_order[C]) = 50

Constraints:
  1) Total chairs lower bound:
     sum_{i∈I} chairs_per_order[i] * x_i  ≥ min_chairs
  2) Total chairs upper bound:
     sum_{i∈I} chairs_per_order[i] * x_i  ≤ max_chairs
  3) Link order count and usage:
     x_i ≤ M[i] * y_i       ∀ i∈I
     x_i ≥ y_i             ∀ i∈I
  4) Logical implications:
     x_B ≥ y_A    // if A is used, at least one B order
     x_C ≥ y_B    // if B is used, at least one C order

Objective:
  Minimize total cost
    min ∑_{i∈I} cost_per_chair[i] * chairs_per_order[i] * x_i
