**DIMENSION 1 – Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis: The model’s data and variable definitions match the narrative. “manufacturers” A, B, C are correctly represented. chairs_per_order and cost_per_chair agree with 15/10/10 chairs and \$50/\$45/\$40 rates. Decision variables x[i] (“number of orders”) and y[i] (“use flag”) are named and scoped appropriately. The minimum (100) and maximum (500) chair bounds are in place.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 – Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
- Objective: correctly minimizes total cost of orders (cost_per_order = chairs_per_order × cost_per_chair).  
- Constraints:  
  • Total chairs ≥100 and ≤500.  
  • Linking x–y: y=0⇒x=0, y=1⇒x≥1, x≤M·y embody correct logical relationships.  
  • Implications A⇒B and B⇒C via indicator constraints enforce “if A used then B used (≥1 order ⇒10 chairs), if B used then C used.”  
- Model type: Mixed‐integer (integer x, binary y) is appropriate.  
No missing constraints nor redundant ones. All variables are correctly typed.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 – Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis: The solver returns an optimal cost of 4000, which corresponds to ordering exactly 10 batches from C (10×10 chairs=100 chairs at \$40 each ⇒ \$4,000). That is the cheapest feasible solution, since C is the lowest‐cost source and the model does not force use of A or B. Constraints are neither infeasible nor unbounded; right‐hand sides and coefficients are reasonable.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:  
Primary Issues: None detected.  
Recommended Actions: The formulation is correct as‐is. No changes necessary.
