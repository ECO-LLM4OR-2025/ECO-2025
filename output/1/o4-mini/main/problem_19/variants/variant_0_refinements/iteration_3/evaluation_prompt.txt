You are an expert operations research analyst. I need your help evaluating and diagnosing issues in an optimization problem solution. Please perform a systematic Chain-of-Thought evaluation across three key dimensions.

    ## Problem Description:
    A furniture store can choose to order chairs from three different manufacturers: A, B, and C. The cost of ordering each chair from manufacturer A is $50, from manufacturer B is $45, and from manufacturer C is $40. The store needs to minimize the total cost of the order.

Additionally, each order from manufacturer A will include 15 chairs, while each order from manufacturers B and C will include 10 chairs. The number of orders must be an integer. The store needs to order at least 100 chairs.

Each order from manufacturer A will include 15 chairs, while each order from manufacturers B and C will include 10 chairs. The store needs to order at most 500 chairs.

If the store decides to order chairs from manufacturer A, it must also order at least 10 chairs from manufacturer B.

Furthermore, if the store decides to order chairs from manufacturer B, it must also order chairs from manufacturer C.

    ## Please perform systematic evaluation across THREE dimensions:

    ### 🔍 Dimension 1: Definition Consistency
    Analyze whether the five element aligns with the problem description:
    - Are all variables properly defined and named according to the problem context?
    - Do the parameter values match what's described in the problem?
    - Are all problem entities (e.g., facilities, customers, resources) correctly represented?
    - Is the problem scope and scale correctly captured?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 2: Structural Soundness  
    Evaluate the mathematical model structure:
    - Is the objective function correctly formulated (minimization vs maximization)?
    - Are all necessary constraints included?
    - Are there any missing or redundant constraints?
    - Is the model type appropriate (linear, integer, mixed-integer)?
    - Are variable types (continuous, binary, integer) correctly specified?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 3: Numerical Validity
    Assess the numerical aspects and execution:
    - If successful: Does the optimal value seem reasonable given the problem context?
    - If failed: What is the root cause of the execution error?
    - Are there any obvious numerical issues (infeasibility, unboundedness)?
    - Are the constraint right-hand-sides and coefficients reasonable?
