Sets:
- I = {A, B, C} (manufacturers)

Variables:
- x[i] for i in I: integer, number of orders from manufacturer i, x[i] ≥ 0.
- y[i] for i in I: binary, 1 if we place at least one order from manufacturer i, 0 otherwise.

Parameters:
- c[A] = 750, c[B] = 450, c[C] = 400  (cost per order from each manufacturer)
- s[A] = 15,  s[B] = 10,  s[C] = 10   (chairs per order)
- min_chairs = 100
- max_chairs = 500
- M[A] = 34   (big-M for A; ≥ max feasible orders = ⌈500/15⌉)
- M[B] = 50   (big-M for B; ≥ max feasible orders = 500/10)
- M[C] = 50   (big-M for C; ≥ max feasible orders = 500/10)

Constraints:
1. Linking order counts to binaries:
   for each i in I:
      x[i] ≥ y[i]
      x[i] ≤ M[i] * y[i]
2. If A is used then B is used: y[A] ≤ y[B]
3. If B is used then C is used: y[B] ≤ y[C]
4. Total chairs lower bound: Σ_{i in I} s[i] * x[i] ≥ min_chairs
5. Total chairs upper bound: Σ_{i in I} s[i] * x[i] ≤ max_chairs

Objective:
- Minimize total cost = Σ_{i in I} c[i] * x[i]
