**DIMENSION 1 – Definition Consistency**  
Diagnosis: The model’s five-tuple (I, x, y, c, s, …) faithfully mirrors the text.  I = {A,B,C} are the three manufacturers; x[i] is “# orders from i,” y[i] flags whether i is used; s and c match chairs-per-order and cost-per-order (derived as $/chair×chairs/order); the minimum/maximum total‐chairs and the “if A then ≥10 chairs from B” and “if B then use C” rules all appear.  The problem scale (100–500 chairs) and integer‐order requirements are correctly captured.  
Issues Found:  
 - The cost parameters c[i] are entered as cost per order (750, 450, 400) rather than parameterizing directly “cost per chair” and letting the model compute c*s.  This is harmless but obscures the original unit cost data.  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 – Structural Soundness**  
Diagnosis:  
 - Objective: correctly a minimization of total cost = ∑ c[i]*x[i].  
 - Constraints:  
    • x[i]≤M[i]·y[i] & x[i]≥y[i] properly link orders to usage binaries.  
    • y[A]≤y[B] enforces “if A is used then B is used” (hence ≥10 chairs from B since x[B]≥1 yields 10 chairs).  
    • y[B]≤y[C] enforces that any B use triggers C use.  
    • Σ s[i]*x[i]∈[100, 500] enforces the overall capacity.  
 - Model type: mixed-integer linear, exactly as required.  
 - No redundant constraints; integrality/binary declarations are correct.  
Issues Found: None  

**DIMENSION 3 – Numerical Validity**  
Diagnosis:  
 - The solver finds cost = 4000 by placing 10 orders with C only (10 orders×10 chairs/order=100 chairs), which is the cheapest feasible solution.  
 - This value is consistent with unit costs ($40/chair ×100 chairs).  
 - No signs of infeasibility or unboundedness; big-M values are tight.  
Issues Found: None  

OVERALL ASSESSMENT  
Primary Issues:  
 1. Minor notational clarity: cost per order vs cost per chair abstraction.  

Recommended Actions:  
 - (Optional) Replace c[i] constants by unit‐cost_per_chair[i] and compute cost in the objective as unit_cost[i]×s[i]×x[i] to keep the original economics transparent.  
 - No structural or numerical corrections needed—the model is correct and the solution is optimal.
