**DIMENSION 1 - Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis:  
- All decision variables and parameters map directly to the textual description.  
- x[i] counts integer orders, y[i] flags whether we order at least one lot.  
- chairs_per_order and cost_per_chair are set correctly to 15/10/10 and \$50/\$45/\$40.  
- The at-least-100 and at-most-500 chair requirements are represented.  
- Logical “if A then ≥10 chairs from B” and “if B then C” are captured via y-linking.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 - Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
- The objective minimizes total cost = (cost_per_chair × chairs_per_order × x).  
- All linkage constraints x ≥ y and x ≤ Mᵢ·y ensure y correctly indicates usage.  
- Logical implications y[A] ≤ y[B] and y[B] ≤ y[C] match “A⇒B” and “B⇒C.”  
- Chair-count constraints enforce the global min/max.  
- The model is a MILP (integer x, binary y) which is appropriate.  
- No redundant or missing constraints; the big-M values are valid upper bounds.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 - Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis:  
- The solver converged to \$4 000, which corresponds to ordering 10 batches from C (10×10 chairs at \$40 each = 100 chairs, \$4 000).  
- This is the cheapest per-chair source and satisfies all min/max and logical rules, so the result is sensible.  
- No infeasibility or unboundedness occurred; all coefficients and RHS values are within expected ranges.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**  
Primary Issues: None – the formulation fully and correctly represents the stated problem.  
Recommended Actions:  
- No changes required for correctness.  
- (Optional) For marginal performance gain, one could tighten big-M by using `ceil(max_chairs/chairs_per_order[i])` instead of floor, but the current M values are already valid.
