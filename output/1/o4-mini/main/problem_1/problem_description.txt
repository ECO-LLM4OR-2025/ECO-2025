A marketing company is planning to allocate resources between two projects: $X$ and $Y$. The total resource allocation for both projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Project $X$ requires a minimum excess of 200 units over project $Y$ to ensure its success. Each unit of resource allocation costs \$50 for project $X$ and \$30 for project $Y$. Both projects can only be allocated whole numbers of resources **(integer, ≥ 0)** due to the indivisible nature of these resources. Moreover, the maximum resource allocation for project X is 700 units **(integer, 0 to 700)** and for project Y is 500 units **(integer, 0 to 500)** due to operational constraints.

Given these conditions, what is the minimum cost (in dollars) required for resource allocation that satisfies all given constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.
