**DIMENSION 1 - Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis: All decision variables, parameters and bounds in the model map exactly to the problem statement. The variables xX and xY are defined with the correct integer domains [0,700] and [0,500], respectively. The two constraints (total capacity ≤1000 and X–Y≥200) precisely reflect the textual requirements. Cost coefficients (\$50 for X, \$30 for Y) match the narrative. There are no stray entities or mismatches in scale.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 - Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
- Objective: correctly set as a minimization of 50·xX + 30·xY.  
- Constraints: both “total capacity” and “minimum excess” are included and neither redundant nor missing.  
- Variable types: integer domain for both xX and xY is appropriate.  
- Model type: integer linear program, exactly as specified.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 - Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis:  
- The solver returns cost = \$10 000 with xX = 200 and xY = 0. This is feasible (200+0≤1000, 200–0≥200) and indeed minimizes cost because adding any Y (even at lower unit cost) drives total expenditure higher while X is already at its minimal feasible level.  
- No indications of infeasibility, unboundedness, or numerical ill‐conditioning.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:  
Primary Issues: None—model fully captures the stated problem and the numeric solution is sound.  
Recommended Actions: No changes required. If business intent was to force a positive allocation to project Y, consider adding a lower bound Y ≥ Y_min or introducing a second objective term (e.g., maximize Y subject to cost tolerance).
