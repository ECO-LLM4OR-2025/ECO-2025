**DIMENSION 1 - Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis:  
- The decision variables x_X and x_Y are named and bounded exactly as per the problem statement (0–700 for X, 0–500 for Y, integer).  
- The cost parameters (50 for X, 30 for Y), the total capacity (≤1000), and the minimum‐excess constraint (x_X – x_Y ≥ 200) all match the original description.  
- There are no missing entities, and the scale (two variables, two constraints) correctly captures the problem scope.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 - Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
- The objective is correctly set to minimization of total cost (50·x_X + 30·x_Y).  
- All necessary constraints are included (total capacity and minimum excess), and there are no extraneous or redundant constraints.  
- The model is formulated as an integer program (both variables are integer), which aligns with the indivisibility requirement.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 - Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis:  
- The solver returns an optimal cost of \$10,000, which corresponds to x_X = 200, x_Y = 0 (the cheapest feasible allocation).  
- There are no indications of infeasibility or unboundedness; a unique, valid solution is found immediately.  
- All coefficients and right-hand sides are within reasonable ranges, and the presolve could eliminate trivial redundancies but did not affect correctness.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**  
Primary Issues: None – the model correctly represents and solves the stated problem.  
Recommended Actions: No changes required. The current formulation and results are accurate and should be used as the final reference.
