**DIMENSION 1 – Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis: The code’s nomenclature, parameter values and variable bounds all directly mirror the written problem. “x_X” and “x_Y” are clearly the integer resource allocations for Projects X and Y; their lower and upper bounds (0–700, 0–500) match exactly; the total-budget cap (≤1000) and minimum-excess requirement (x_X–x_Y ≥ 200) are both present. There is no mismatch in units or missing entities.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 – Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
- Objective: correctly set to MINIMIZE 50·x_X + 30·x_Y.  
- Constraints: both the total-resource constraint and the success/excess constraint are included and correctly oriented.  
- Variable types: integer, with explicit bounds, as required by the problem.  
- No redundant constraints; no needed constraints are missing.  
- Model type (pure integer programming) is appropriate.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 – Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis:  
- The solver finds cost = 10000.  Checking by hand: to minimize cost you set x_Y as small as possible (since adding one Y forces one extra X at a net +\$80), so x_Y=0, x_X=200 satisfies x_X–x_Y=200 and x_X+x_Y=200≤1000.  Cost=50·200=10000.  
- No signs of infeasibility or unboundedness; right-hand sides and cost coefficients are all reasonable.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:  
Primary Issues: None – the model fully and correctly implements the stated integer-programming problem, and the numerical result is exactly the expected minimum cost.  
Recommended Actions: No changes needed. The formulation, implementation, and solution are all correct.
