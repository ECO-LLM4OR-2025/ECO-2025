**DIMENSION 1 – Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis:  
All model entities map directly to the problem statement. The decision variables x_X and x_Y are named clearly, have the correct integrality (integer ≥ 0), and their upper bounds (700 and 500) match the operational limits. The costs (\$50 per unit of X, \$30 per unit of Y) are implemented correctly in the objective. Both the total‐resource constraint (x_X + x_Y ≤ 1000) and the excess requirement (x_X – x_Y ≥ 200) are present. There are no extraneous variables or parameters.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 – Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
The mathematical formulation is a pure integer linear program, which is appropriate. The objective is correctly set to minimization of total cost. All problem constraints—including variable bounds, the total‐resource limit, and the X-over-Y minimum gap—are included and none are duplicated or missing. Variable types are correctly specified as integer. The model structure is both necessary and sufficient to capture the described planning problem.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 – Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis:  
The solver returns an optimal cost of \$10 000, which corresponds to the corner solution (x_X=200, x_Y=0) and is fully consistent with cost coefficients and constraints (cheapest allocation occurs by using the bare minimum for X to satisfy the 200‐unit excess, and zero for Y). No infeasibilities or unbounded directions are detected, and all right‐hand‐sides and coefficients lie in expected ranges. The integer rounding of the final cost is inconsequential since the true optimum is integral.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**  
Primary Issues: None—model and code fully align with the problem, and the numerical result is both feasible and interpretable.  
Recommended Actions: No changes required; the current formulation is correct and produces the valid minimum cost.
