Sets:
  P = {X, Y}  (set of projects)

Variables:
  x_X ∈ Integer, 0 ≤ x_X ≤ 700  (allocation to project X)
  x_Y ∈ Integer, 0 ≤ x_Y ≤ 500  (allocation to project Y)

Parameters:
  C_X = 50   (cost per unit for project X)
  C_Y = 30   (cost per unit for project Y)
  R_total = 1000   (maximum total resources available)
  Δ = 200         (minimum excess of X over Y)

Constraints:
  1. Total resource constraint: x_X + x_Y ≤ R_total
  2. Excess requirement:        x_X - x_Y ≥ Δ
  3. Bounds on X:               0 ≤ x_X ≤ 700
  4. Bounds on Y:               0 ≤ x_Y ≤ 500
  5. Integrality:               x_X, x_Y are integers

Objective:
  Minimize total cost = C_X * x_X + C_Y * x_Y
