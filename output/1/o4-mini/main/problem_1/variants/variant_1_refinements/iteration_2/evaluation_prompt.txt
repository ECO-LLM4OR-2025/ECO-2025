You are an expert operations research analyst. I need your help evaluating and diagnosing issues in an optimization problem solution. Please perform a systematic Chain-of-Thought evaluation across three key dimensions.

    ## Problem Description:
    A marketing company is planning to allocate resources between two projects: $X$ and $Y$. The total resource allocation for both projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Project $X$ requires a minimum excess of 200 units over project $Y$ to ensure its success. Each unit of resource allocation costs \$50 for project $X$ and \$30 for project $Y$. Both projects can only be allocated whole numbers of resources **(integer, ≥ 0)** due to the indivisible nature of these resources. Moreover, the maximum resource allocation for project X is 700 units **(integer, 0 to 700)** and for project Y is 500 units **(integer, 0 to 500)** due to operational constraints.

Given these conditions, what is the minimum cost (in dollars) required for resource allocation that satisfies all given constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar. 

Modeling Type: Integer Programming.

    ## Please perform systematic evaluation across THREE dimensions:

    ### 🔍 Dimension 1: Definition Consistency
    Analyze whether the five element aligns with the problem description:
    - Are all variables properly defined and named according to the problem context?
    - Do the parameter values match what's described in the problem?
    - Are all problem entities (e.g., facilities, customers, resources) correctly represented?
    - Is the problem scope and scale correctly captured?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 2: Structural Soundness  
    Evaluate the mathematical model structure:
    - Is the objective function correctly formulated (minimization vs maximization)?
    - Are all necessary constraints included?
    - Are there any missing or redundant constraints?
    - Is the model type appropriate (linear, integer, mixed-integer)?
    - Are variable types (continuous, binary, integer) correctly specified?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 3: Numerical Validity
    Assess the numerical aspects and execution:
    - If successful: Does the optimal value seem reasonable given the problem context?
    - If failed: What is the root cause of the execution error?
    - Are there any obvious numerical issues (infeasibility, unboundedness)?
    - Are the constraint right-hand-sides and coefficients reasonable?
