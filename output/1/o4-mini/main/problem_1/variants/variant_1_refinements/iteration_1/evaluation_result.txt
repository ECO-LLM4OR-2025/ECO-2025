**DIMENSION 1 - Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis: The five‐element tuple correctly mirrors the problem narrative.  The set of projects P={X,Y} is defined, each decision variable x_X, x_Y is integer, nonnegative and bounded by the stated capacities (700 and 500).  Parameters c_X, c_Y, B, d, M_X and M_Y all match the problem text.  There are no extra or missing entities.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 - Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
- Objective: correctly formulated as a minimization of total cost 50·x_X + 30·x_Y.  
- All stated constraints appear exactly once:  
  1) x_X + x_Y ≤ 1000  
  2) x_X – x_Y ≥ 200  
  3) 0 ≤ x_X ≤ 700, 0 ≤ x_Y ≤ 500 (via variable bounds)  
- The model is an integer program, which is appropriate since resources must be whole.  
- No constraints are redundant, nor is any required constraint missing.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 - Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis:  
- Gurobi finds x_X=200, x_Y=0 with cost = 50·200 + 30·0 = \$10,000.  This is exactly the minimum feasible allocation: you only allocate the mandatory 200 to X to satisfy the “excess” constraint and allocate zero to Y to keep cost as low as possible.  
- All coefficients and RHS values are consistent and lead to a perfectly feasible, bounded problem.  
Issues Found: None  
Confidence: High  

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**  
Primary Issues:  
- None of the implemented model elements contradict the problem statement or each other.  

Recommended Actions:  
- No fixes needed.  The model correctly captures the stated integer program and produces the correct minimum‐cost solution of \$10,000.
