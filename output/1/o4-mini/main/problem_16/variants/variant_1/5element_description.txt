Sets:
- T = {1, 2, 3} (months in the first quarter)

Variables (all continuous, nonnegative):
- q_t ≥ 0: quantity purchased at the beginning of month t, ∀ t ∈ T
- s_t ≥ 0: quantity sold during month t, ∀ t ∈ T
- I_t ≥ 0: inventory at the end of month t, ∀ t ∈ T

Parameters:
- p_buy_t: purchasing price in month t, where p_buy_1=8, p_buy_2=6, p_buy_3=9
- p_sell_t: selling price in month t, where p_sell_1=9, p_sell_2=8, p_sell_3=10
- I_0 = 200: initial inventory at the end of last year
- C = 500: warehouse capacity (max inventory)

Constraints:
1. Inventory balance for each t ∈ T:
   I_{t-1} + q_t − s_t = I_t
   (with I_0 given = 200)
2. Capacity limit for each t ∈ T:
   I_t ≤ C
3. Nonnegativity:
   q_t ≥ 0, s_t ≥ 0, I_t ≥ 0  ∀ t ∈ T

Objective:
Maximize total profit = Σ_{t∈T} [ p_sell_t * s_t − p_buy_t * q_t ]
