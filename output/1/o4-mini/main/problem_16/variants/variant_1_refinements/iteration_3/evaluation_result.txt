**DIMENSION 1 – Definition Consistency**  
Diagnosis:  
The code mostly follows the textbook “order, sell, hold” notation with  
• qₜ = units purchased in month t  
• sₜ = units sold in month t  
• Iₜ = end-of-month inventory   
and parameters I₀=200, C=500, purchase/sale prices match Table 1.3.  However, the model introduces a monthly demand cap, a holding cost h=0.5, and a salvage value – none of which appear in the original problem statement. These additions change both the economic trade-offs and the feasible region.  

Issues Found:  
1. Demand limits (`demand = {1:200,2:250,3:300}`) are not stated in the problem.  
2. A holding cost (`h=0.5`) and salvage value are introduced without justification.  
3. No explicit lower‐bounds on q and s are coded (Gurobi defaults to ≥0, but it is not documented).  

Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 – Structural Soundness**  
Diagnosis:  
Given the augmented model, the inventory‐balance constraints, end-of-month capacity (Iₜ ≤500), demand caps on sales, and an integer formulation are all plausible. The objective (maximize revenue – purchase cost – holding cost + salvage) is correctly coded for that variant.  

However, critical structural mis-specifications remain:  
• Capacity applies only to end-of-month inventory Iₜ, not to the inventory immediately after purchase and before sales. As written, one can buy up to C + sₜ units in month t without triggering the capacity constraint.  
• No restriction prevents purchasing more units than will ever be sold. That, combined with zero salvage penalty at t=3, invites “buy-and-hoard” arbitrage from the mid-quarter low price.  

Issues Found:  
1. Missing “post-purchase pre-sale” capacity constraint: Iₜ₋₁ + qₜ ≤ C + sₜ or equivalently Iₜ₋₁ + qₜ ≤ C if sales occur after stocking.  
2. No upper bound on qₜ tied to either physical limits or future demand.  
3. Holding costs are only charged on I₁, I₂ but not on I₃; salvage_value=0 yet no penalty, so leftover stock is “free” at horizon.  

Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 – Numerical Validity**  
Diagnosis:  
The solver runs to optimality and returns 3350. Checking that number against the coded model finds:  
• Sell 200 in month 1, 250 in month 2, 300 in month 3  
• Purchase 550 in month 2 (250 to meet month 2 demand + 300 to hold for month 3), zero elsewhere  
• End I₁=0, I₂=300, I₃=0  
This yields exactly 3350 in the revenue–cost–holding calculation. Numerically, the code is consistent.  

However, from a business standpoint the “buy‐at‐6 in month 2 to stock for month 3” loophole is purely an artifact of the missing constraints and extra parameters. The profit number is therefore not meaningful for the original problem.  

Issues Found:  
1. No infeasibility or unboundedness flagged, but the profit 3350 relies on the unwarranted demand and holding-cost structure.  
2. Coefficients are reasonable given the augmented model, but the model is economically mis-specified.  

Confidence: High  

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**  
Primary Issues:  
1. Introduction of un-specified demand caps and holding/salvage terms (Dimension 1).  
2. Missing capacity constraint immediately after purchase (Dimension 2).  
3. No limit on purchases relative to future sales, allowing artificial arbitrage (Dimension 2).  

Recommended Actions:  
1. Revert to the original problem statement: remove `demand` caps, holding cost h, and salvage unless explicitly required.  
2. If demand limits truly exist, document them in the problem description and tie qₜ to maximum possible future sales (e.g. ∑ₖ₌ₜ^T sₖ).  
3. Enforce storage capacity at the moment of receipt: add constraint  
   for each t: I[t-1] + q[t] ≤ C + s[t]  
   or (if sales happen after stocking) simply I[t-1] + q[t] ≤ C  
4. If an ending inventory cost or salvage value is desired, decide whether to charge holding cost on I₃ or to apply a nonzero salvage penalty, and code it explicitly.  

With these fixes, the LP will again reflect the true trade-offs of buy vs. sell vs. hold in months 1–3.
