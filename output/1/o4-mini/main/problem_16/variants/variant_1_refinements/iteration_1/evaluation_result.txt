**DIMENSION 1 – Definition Consistency:**  
Diagnosis:  
The model’s sets, variables, and parameters correctly mirror the verbal description of purchases, sales, and inventory balance over three months. The purchasing and selling prices, initial inventory, and warehouse capacity all match the problem statement.

Issues Found:  
- The original problem statement never mentions any limits on how much can be sold in each month (demand). As formulated, sales quantities s_t are unconstrained aside from inventory balance.  
- There is no supplier‐side capacity or budget constraint on purchases, so q_t is also unbounded above.  

Confidence: High

**DIMENSION 2 – Structural Soundness:**  
Diagnosis:  
The inventory‐flow constraints and capacity limits are correctly written and linear; the objective is properly set to maximize total profit. Variable types (continuous, ≥0) are appropriate if fractional units are allowed.

Issues Found:  
- Missing demand constraints of the form s_t ≤ D_t (one per month) that cap how much can actually be sold.  
- (Optionally) Missing any upper bound on q_t (e.g. supplier capacity or budget). Without these, the LP is unbounded.  

Confidence: High

**DIMENSION 3 – Numerical Validity:**  
Diagnosis:  
Gurobi reports “Infeasible or unbounded model.” Given the structure, it is in fact unbounded: a positive margin exists in month 2 (buy at 6, sell at 8) and month 3 (buy at 9, sell at 10). With no demand ceiling, one can buy arbitrary quantities, sell them immediately (keeping end‐of‐month inventory = 0 to respect capacity), and drive profit to +∞.

Issues Found:  
- No upper bounds on q_t or s_t ⇒ unbounded objective.  
- The “Infeasible or unbounded” message stems from Gurobi’s presolve detecting unboundedness.

Confidence: High

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:  
Primary Issues:  
1. Lack of demand constraints s_t ≤ D_t ⇒ unbounded sales and profit.  
2. No caps on purchase quantities (supplier capacity or budget), reinforcing unboundedness.  

Recommended Actions:  
- Introduce monthly demand parameters D_1, D_2, D_3 and add constraints s[t] ≤ D[t] for t∈{1,2,3}.  
- If applicable, add supplier or budget limits on purchases (e.g. q[t] ≤ Q_max[t]).  
- Re‐solve and verify that the model becomes bounded and yields a finite optimal plan.
