Sets:
T = {1, 2, 3}  // Index set for months

Variables:
x_t ≥ 0  (continuous)  // Units purchased in month t, for t ∈ T
y_t ≥ 0  (continuous)  // Units sold in month t, for t ∈ T
s_t ≥ 0  (continuous)  // Inventory at the end of month t, for t ∈ T

Parameters:
b_t       // Purchase price in month t (b_1=8, b_2=6, b_3=9)
p_t       // Selling price in month t  (p_1=9, p_2=8, p_3=10)
s0 = 200  // Initial inventory at end of month 0
S_max = 500 // Warehouse capacity

Constraints:
1) Inventory balance for each t ∈ T:
   s_t = (s_{t-1}) + x_t - y_t
   where s_{0} = s0

2) Capacity limit for each t ∈ T:
   s_t ≤ S_max

3) Non-negativity for all decision variables:
   x_t, y_t, s_t ≥ 0

Objective:
Maximize total profit = ∑_{t ∈ T} (p_t * y_t − b_t * x_t)
