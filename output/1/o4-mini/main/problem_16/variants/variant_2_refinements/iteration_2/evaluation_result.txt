**DIMENSION 1 – Definition Consistency**  
Diagnosis:  
‐  The code correctly introduces decision variables Pₜ (purchases), Sₜ (sales) and Iₜ (end‐of‐month inventory) and names them in line with the problem description. Purchase prices cₜ, selling prices sₜ, initial inventory I₀ and warehouse capacity Cap are all set exactly as stated.  
‐  However, the original problem statement never specifies month‐by‐month demand numbers Dₜ; the code has simply hard-coded example values (300, 400, 350) and comments that these “should be replaced by real forecasts.” This means the solution is not fully aligned with the problem as given – the demands are an essential input but were omitted in the statement.  
‐  The user wants not only the optimal profit but also the purchase and sales plan; yet the code writes only the objective value to file and never reports the optimal Pₜ, Sₜ or Iₜ levels.  

Issues Found:  
1. Demand parameters Dₜ are not defined in the original problem and must be obtained or specified by the user.  
2. The code only outputs the optimal profit value; it fails to output the actual Pₜ, Sₜ (and Iₜ) decisions that the user needs.  

Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 – Structural Soundness**  
Diagnosis:  
‐  Objective: correctly stated as a maximization of revenue minus purchase cost, ∑ₜ(sₜ·Sₜ – cₜ·Pₜ).  
‐  Inventory balance constraints are exactly those required: Iₜ = Iₜ₋₁ + Pₜ – Sₜ, with I₀ = 200.  
‐  Warehouse capacity is enforced both “instantaneously” (Iₜ₋₁ + Pₜ ≤ Cap) and “end‐of‐month” (Iₜ ≤ Cap). Both are defensible if purchases arrive before the sales in each month.  
‐  Demand constraints Sₜ ≤ Dₜ are included.  
‐  Nonnegativity is enforced on P, S, I. All variables are continuous. The problem as stated does not require integer crossings, so LP is appropriate; if one believes product units must be integral, one could switch P and S to integer type.  

Issues Found:  
None critical to correctness of the LP. (One could argue that continuous P and S may allow fractional units, but for large batch orders that is typically acceptable.)  

Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 – Numerical Validity**  
Diagnosis:  
‐  Gurobi solves in “OPTIMAL” status and returns profit = 3600. That number is plausible given the price spreads (month 2 purchase to month 3 sale yields a Δ = 10–6 = 4 per unit, month 1 margin =1, month 2 direct =2).  
‐  No unboundedness or infeasibility warning appears. RHS values (capacity =500, demands 300/400/350) and coefficients are all within normal ranges.  
‐  Because initial inventory carries no purchase‐cost in the model, the solver may treat those 200 units as “free” and exploit them at the highest margin opportunities; if the user intended to include a sunk cost for initial stock or impose a terminal inventory requirement (e.g. I₃ ≥ 200), that would change the numerical result.  

Issues Found:  
None obvious from a pure LP‐execution standpoint. (If the user cares about salvage value or nonzero end‐inventory, further constraints or adjustments would be needed.)  

Confidence: High  

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**  
Primary Issues:  
1. Missing demand data in the problem statement – demands Dₜ are essential inputs but were not provided.  
2. The code writes only the optimal profit to file; it never exports the recommended Pₜ and Sₜ decisions that the user needs.  

Recommended Actions:  
a) Require the user to supply a vector Dₜ of monthly demand forecasts (or embed realistic demand data in the model).  
b) After `m.optimize()`, extract and report the optimal values of P[t], S[t] (and I[t]) in addition to the objective. For example:  
   ­ for t in T: print(t, P[t].x, S[t].x, I[t].x)  
c) If product units must be integral, change `vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS` to `vtype=GRB.INTEGER` for P and S.  
d) If the user requires no leftover inventory at quarter end or a minimum final stock, add a constraint such as `m.addConstr(I[3] == 0)` or `I[3] >= I_end_target`.  

Implementing these will align the solution fully with the problem requirements and yield actionable purchase/sales plans, not just a profit number.
