**DIMENSION 1 – Definition Consistency**  
Diagnosis:  
• Sets, parameters and decision variables (Pₜ, Sₜ, Iₜ) are all named consistently with the description.  
• Purchase prices cₜ={8,6,9}, selling prices sₜ={9,8,10}, initial inventory I₀=200 and capacity Cap=500 match exactly.  
• The only “entity” missing is any representation of market demand or an upper bound on sales; the problem text never specifies how many units can actually be sold in a month.  

Issues Found:  
1. Missing demand (or maximum‐sales) parameter Dₜ and constraint Sₜ ≤ Dₜ (the model currently allows selling unlimited units).  

Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 2 – Structural Soundness**  
Diagnosis:  
• Objective is correctly set to maximize total profit ∑(sₜ·Sₜ – cₜ·Pₜ).  
• Inventory balance constraints Iₜ = Iₜ₋₁ + Pₜ – Sₜ are correct for end‐of‐period stock.  
• Capacity constraint Iₜ ≤ 500 on end‐of‐month inventory is syntactically correct but does not prevent “buy then sell” in the same period from violating the intuitive warehouse limit at the instant of receipt.  
• All variables are naturally continuous and nonnegative; integer flows are not required here.  

Issues Found:  
1. No sales‐limit or demand constraint → model becomes unbounded when selling price exceeds purchase price.  
2. Warehouse capacity is applied only to Iₜ, not to “inventory-on‐hand + incoming purchases” before sales; this allows violating physical capacity if you instantaneously purchase and then sell.  

Confidence: High  

**DIMENSION 3 – Numerical Validity**  
Diagnosis:  
• Solver returned “Infeasible or unbounded.”  Presolve removed rows and then immediately concluded no bounds on profit.  
• Because you can choose an arbitrarily large P₁, set S₁ = I₀ + P₁ (so I₁ = 0 and capacity holds), each extra unit generates (9–8)=1 Yuan profit, driving the model unbounded.  

Issues Found:  
1. Unbounded profit due to missing upper bound on Sₜ (i.e. no demand constraint).  
2. Missing instantaneous capacity check on Pₜ + Iₜ₋₁ before Sₜ occurs allows arbitrarily large buys followed by same‐period sells.  

Confidence: High  

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**  
Primary Issues (in order):  
1. No demand constraint → unbounded sales/purchases.  
2. Mis‐specified capacity constraint (should cap Iₜ₋₁+Pₜ, not only Iₜ).  

Recommended Actions:  
• Introduce a parameter Dₜ for monthly maximum demand and add  Sₜ ≤ Dₜ ∀ t.  
• Either  
   – Change warehouse constraint to Iₜ₋₁ + Pₜ ≤ Cap (so you cannot receive more than capacity before selling), or  
   – Enforce a sequencing: split Pₜ and Sₜ into “pre‐sale” and “post‐sale” balances, or tighten the model so that Pₜ ≤ Cap – Iₜ₋₁.  
• If final inventory I₃ must meet a target or incurs holding costs, model that explicitly to avoid end‐of‐horizon anomalies.  

These fixes will restore boundedness and ensure the solution is physically and economically meaningful.
