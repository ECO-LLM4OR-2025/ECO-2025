You are an expert operations research analyst. I need your help evaluating and diagnosing issues in an optimization problem solution. Please perform a systematic Chain-of-Thought evaluation across three key dimensions.

    ## Problem Description:
    A store plans to formulate the purchasing and sales plan for a certain product for the first quarter of next year. It is known that the warehouse capacity of the store can store up to 500 units of the product, and there are 200 units in stock at the end of this year. The store purchases goods once at the beginning of each month. The purchasing and selling prices of the product in each month are shown in Table 1.3.

Table 1.3

| Month | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Purchasing Price (Yuan) | 8 | 6 | 9 |
| Selling Price (Yuan) | 9 | 8 | 10 |

Now, determine how many units should be purchased and sold each month to maximize the total profit, and express this problem as a linear programming model.

    ## Current Iteration: 1

    ## Variant Information:
    
### 5-Element Problem Analysis:
Sets:
T = {1,2,3}  // months in the planning horizon

Variables:
P_t ≥ 0  continuous  // units purchased in month t
S_t ≥ 0  continuous  // units sold in month t
I_t ≥ 0  continuous  // inventory at the end of month t

Parameters:
c_t = {8, 6, 9}      // purchase price in month t
s_t = {9, 8, 10}     // selling price in month t
I_0 = 200            // initial inventory at start of month 1
Cap = 500            // warehouse capacity

Constraints:
1. Inventory balance for each t ∈ T:
   I_t = I_{t-1} + P_t - S_t

2. Capacity limit for each t ∈ T:
   I_t ≤ Cap

3. Nonnegativity:
   P_t ≥ 0, S_t ≥ 0, I_t ≥ 0 ∀ t ∈ T

Objective:
Maximize total profit:
   Maximize ∑_{t∈T} (s_t * S_t − c_t * P_t)

### Current Solution Code:
```python
import gurobipy as gp
from gurobipy import GRB

# Data
T = [1, 2, 3]
c = {1: 8, 2: 6, 3: 9}    # purchase prices
s = {1: 9, 2: 8, 3: 10}   # selling prices
I0 = 200                  # initial inventory
Cap = 500                 # warehouse capacity

# Model
m = gp.Model("Purchasing_and_Sales_Plan")

# Decision variables
P = m.addVars(T, name="P", lb=0, vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS)  # purchased units
S = m.addVars(T, name="S", lb=0, vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS)  # sold units
I = m.addVars(T, name="I", lb=0, vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS)  # end inventory

# Constraints
# Inventory balance
for t in T:
    if t == 1:
        m.addConstr(I[t] == I0 + P[t] - S[t], name=f"inv_balance_{t}")
    else:
        m.addConstr(I[t] == I[t-1] + P[t] - S[t], name=f"inv_balance_{t}")

# Warehouse capacity
for t in T:
    m.addConstr(I[t] <= Cap, name=f"capacity_{t}")

# Objective: maximize profit
obj = gp.quicksum(s[t] * S[t] - c[t] * P[t] for t in T)
m.setObjective(obj, GRB.MAXIMIZE)

# Solve
m.optimize()

# Write optimal objective value to file
if m.status == GRB.OPTIMAL:
    with open('ref_optimal_value.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(m.objVal))
else:
    with open('ref_optimal_value.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write("No optimal solution found.")
```

    ## Please perform systematic evaluation across THREE dimensions:

    ### 🔍 Dimension 1: Definition Consistency
    Analyze whether the five element aligns with the problem description:
    - Are all variables properly defined and named according to the problem context?
    - Do the parameter values match what's described in the problem?
    - Are all problem entities (e.g., facilities, customers, resources) correctly represented?
    - Is the problem scope and scale correctly captured?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 2: Structural Soundness  
    Evaluate the mathematical model structure:
    - Is the objective function correctly formulated (minimization vs maximization)?
    - Are all necessary constraints included?
    - Are there any missing or redundant constraints?
    - Is the model type appropriate (linear, integer, mixed-integer)?
    - Are variable types (continuous, binary, integer) correctly specified?

    ### 🔍 Dimension 3: Numerical Validity
    Assess the numerical aspects and execution:
    - If successful: Does the optimal value seem reasonable given the problem context?
    - If failed: What is the root cause of the execution error?
    - Are there any obvious numerical issues (infeasibility, unboundedness)?
    - Are the constraint right-hand-sides and coefficients reasonable?
